Hi guys in this video I have made a automatic wire cutter and stripper machine,
I have used a nextion 2.8" HMI for user interface from it you can enter the desire length of cuts for wire.

This machine feed the wire of desire length and strip the end of desire length 

I have used a stepper motor feeding system to feed wire upto cutter and other stepper motor

is connected with cutter which cut and strip the wire.

I have placed a servo motor which direct the wire for full cut and half cut.
