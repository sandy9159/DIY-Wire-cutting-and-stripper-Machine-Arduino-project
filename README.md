Hi guys in this video I have made a automatic wire cutter and stripper machine,
I have used a nextion 2.8" HMI for user interface from it you can enter the desire length of cuts for wire.

This machine feed the wire of desire length and strip the end of desire length 

I have used a stepper motor feeding system to feed wire upto cutter and other stepper motor

is connected with cutter which cut and strip the wire.

I have placed a servo motor which direct the wire for full cut and half cut.

This the link of complete video you can watch the video from here where I have demonstrated complete steps in 
order to build this cool arduino based wire cutting and striping machine.

# COMPONENTS 

> Arduino nano


> A4988 Stepper driver


> Nextion HMI


> Micro servo motor


> wire cutter


> Custom PCB


> Some 3D printed parts



# CONSTRUCTION

First I cut the wooden shet of size 150 x 150 mm 

I have used 12mm birch plywood for the  based and cut it by using my table saw.

I have design some of my parts in fusion 360 and 3D printed them

I have used PLA filament with almost 50% infill PLA is very best material

for such purpose its easy to work with PLA filament 

I will leave the link to download the 3D files
