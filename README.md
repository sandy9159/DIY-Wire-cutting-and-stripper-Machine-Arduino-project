Hi guys in this video I have made a automatic wire cutter and stripper machine,
I have used a nextion 2.8" HMI for user interface from it you can enter the desire length of cuts for wire.

This machine feed the wire of desire length and strip the end of desire length 

I have used a stepper motor feeding system to feed wire upto cutter and other stepper motor

is connected with cutter which cut and strip the wire.

I have placed a servo motor which direct the wire for full cut and half cut.

This the link of complete video you can watch the video from here where I have demonstrated complete steps in 
order to build this cool arduino based wire cutting and striping machine.

# COMPONENTS 

> Arduino nano


> A4988 Stepper driver


> Nextion HMI


> Micro servo motor


> wire cutter


> Custom PCB


> Some 3D printed parts



# CONSTRUCTION

First I cut the wooden shet of size 150 x 150 mm 

I have used 12mm birch plywood for the  based and cut it by using my table saw.

I have design some of my parts in fusion 360 and 3D printed them

I have used PLA filament with almost 50% infill PLA is very best material

for such purpose its easy to work with PLA filament 

I will leave the link to download the 3D files

Then I placed all the 3D printed parts on woden base

and mark the location for hole, then I drill it out using my stand drill

all holes are of 4mm so we can easily fit 3mm Screw through it and leave some tolerance for further adjustment.

This is wire feeding mechanism which made using 3D printed parts.

This system push wire to teethed pully as stepper motor rotates wire will feed to the cutter.

This is the wire cutter, I have removed its grip from the handle

so it can easily fit in the 3D printed parts and secure it tightly to the wooden base

I have made a small grove on the upper handle, I this grove is used to connect 

the wire which is connected to the cutter stepper  motor so that when the 

cutter stepper motor rotates it pull the cutter handle done and we can cut the wire during this process.
